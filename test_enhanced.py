Product Planning Meeting - August 23, 2024
Attendees: John (PM), Sarah (Dev), Mike (QA), Lisa (Designer)

John: Let's discuss the upcoming authentication feature. Sarah, what's your timeline?
Sarah: I can complete the JWT implementation by Friday, August 30th.

Mike: How should we handle password complexity requirements?
Sarah: Good question. Let's use standard complexity - 8 chars minimum, mixed case, numbers.

Lisa: What about the login page design? Do we have wireframes?
John: We need those. Lisa, can you create mockups by Wednesday?
Lisa: Yes, I'll have login and signup mockups ready by Wednesday morning.

Mike: Are we implementing 2FA in this release?
John: That's a great question. What do you think Sarah?
Sarah: I think we should focus on basic auth first, then 2FA in the next sprint.

Sarah: I'll also need to update the API documentation after implementation.

Mike: How do we test the authentication flow end-to-end?
[No immediate answer - discussion moves to other topics]

John: One more thing - what database should we use for user sessions?
Sarah: Redis would be good for session storage, it's fast and handles expiration well.

Lisa: Should the login form have a "Remember Me" checkbox?
[Question raised but not answered during meeting]

John: Let's make sure we have proper error handling for failed logins.
Sarah: Absolutely, I'll add rate limiting and clear error messages.
