# Future Development Ideas

## Meeting Assistant Enhancement Vision

Transform the current JIRA task extraction tool into a comprehensive **Meeting Assistant** with automated workflow integration.

### Proposed Flow:

#### 1. Pre-Meeting Setup
- **Slack Integration**: Notify designated Slack channel when a meeting is scheduled to start
- **Permission Request**: Ask participants for permission to record/take notes
- **Automated Setup**: Initialize note-taking and transcription services

#### 2. During Meeting
- **Real-time Transcription**: Use integrated note-taker service to capture meeting audio/content
- **Live Processing**: Optionally provide real-time task identification (low priority)
- **Participant Management**: Track who's speaking, action item assignments

#### 3. Post-Meeting Automation
- **API Integration**: Once meeting ends, automatically trigger our current task extraction endpoint
- **Data Processing**: Extract tasks, Q&A items, action items, and decisions
- **Slack Notification**: Post results back to the same Slack thread with:
  - Summary of extracted tasks
  - Q&A items that need follow-up
  - Action items with assigned owners
  - Meeting summary and key decisions

### Technical Implementation Ideas:

#### Slack Integration Components:
- **Slack Bot**: Create a bot that can:
  - Monitor calendar integrations for upcoming meetings
  - Send permission requests to meeting participants
  - Post pre-meeting and post-meeting notifications
  - Create threaded conversations for each meeting

#### Note-taking Integration:
- **Audio Transcription**: Integrate with services like:
  - Otter.ai API
  - Google Speech-to-Text
  - Azure Speech Services
  - Custom Whisper implementation
- **Meeting Platform Hooks**: Integrate with:
  - Zoom webhooks/API
  - Google Meet recording
  - Microsoft Teams recording
  - Generic audio input capture

#### Enhanced Data Processing:
- **Meeting Metadata**: Capture and process:
  - Meeting duration and participants
  - Key decisions made
  - Follow-up meetings scheduled
  - Risk items identified
  - Blocked items requiring escalation

#### Advanced Features:
- **Smart Summarization**:
  - Executive summary for leadership
  - Technical summary for development teams
  - Action-focused summary for project managers
- **Integration Ecosystem**:
  - JIRA ticket creation (current functionality)
  - Notion page updates
  - Confluence documentation
  - Calendar event creation for follow-ups
  - Email summaries to stakeholders

### Development Phases:

#### Phase 1: Slack Integration Foundation
- Create Slack bot with basic notification capabilities
- Implement meeting start/end detection
- Build threaded conversation management

#### Phase 2: Transcription Integration
- Integrate with transcription service APIs
- Build audio file processing pipeline
- Implement real-time vs batch processing options

#### Phase 3: Enhanced Processing
- Expand current task extraction to include:
  - Decision tracking
  - Risk identification
  - Follow-up meeting suggestions
  - Participant action assignment

#### Phase 4: Multi-platform Integration
- JIRA integration (already implemented)
- Notion/Confluence documentation
- Calendar integration for follow-ups
- Email reporting capabilities

### Benefits:
- **Reduced Administrative Overhead**: Eliminate manual note-taking and follow-up creation
- **Improved Accountability**: Automatic action item tracking and assignment
- **Better Meeting ROI**: Ensure every meeting produces actionable outcomes
- **Consistent Documentation**: Standardized meeting summaries and task creation
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Centralized meeting insights accessible to all stakeholders

### Current Status:
- âœ… Core task extraction functionality implemented
- âœ… Multi-format export capabilities (CSV, JSON, Excel)
- âœ… Document type detection (refinement docs vs meeting transcripts)
- âœ… Q&A extraction and tracking
- ðŸš§ Ready for meeting assistant expansion
