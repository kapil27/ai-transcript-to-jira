Sprint Planning Meeting - Aug 23, 2024
Attendees: John (PM), Sarah (Dev), Mike (QA), Lisa (Designer)

John: Let's start the sprint planning. Sarah, what's the timeline for the authentication API?
Sarah: I can complete the JWT implementation by Friday, August 30th.

Mike: How should we handle error logging in the new API?
John: Good question. Let's use our standard logging framework.
Sarah: I'll make sure to include proper error handling.

Lisa: What about the UI design for the login page?
John: We'll need to finalize that. Can you have mockups ready by Wednesday?
Lisa: Yes, I can deliver the mockups by Wednesday morning.

Mike: Are we going to implement 2FA in this sprint?
Sarah: That's a good question, but I think we should focus on basic auth first.
John: Agreed, let's save 2FA for the next sprint.

John: One more thing - what database should we use for user sessions?
Sarah: I was thinking Redis for session storage.

Mike: How do we test the authentication flow?
[No immediate answer - discussion continues on other topics]

Sarah: Oh, and what's our deployment strategy for this?
John: We'll deploy to staging first, then production after QA approval.
